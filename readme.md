# .NET Todo App

This is a Todo application that I am using to learn C# and .NET.

I will be developing this application in stages:

1. REPL-like interface with in-memory storage.
2. File persisted storage with command line usage.
3. SQLite storage using Entity Framework with command line usage.
4. Server-Client interaction via Web Sockets.
5. Hosted web server with JavaScript framework client.

I will be using a git branch for each stage, as well as using feature branching on those branches.
